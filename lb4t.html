            <h4>Modernizing a 40+ year old company</h4>
            <hr>

            <p><a href="http://dat.com/">DAT Solutions</a> operates the United States' largest freight marketplace &mdash; also known as "load boards". Load boards help truck drivers, brokers, and shippers keep our roads loaded with freight. Think of a load board as a "Craigslist for truckers", a place where brokers and shippers list their freight and truckers (typically owner-operators) post their availability.</p>
            <p>I was one of three visual designers assigned the task of giving DAT's entire product suite a visual and UX overhaul using Google's Material Design as a starting point. It felt like a herculean task as some products hadn't been updated in over a decade, but the first product I took on was their newest, <strong>OnTime</strong>.</p>

            <h4>OnTime</h4>
            <hr>

            <h5>What is OnTime?</h5>
            <p>OnTime is a product that allows freight brokers and shippers to track drivers carrying their freight. Drivers download OnTime's app on their phones and are tracked for a shipment's duration via GPS. Brokers and shippers check OnTime's web app to see real time updates regarding their freight's location. OnTime sets itself apart from competitors with features like in-app messaging, real time location updates, and giving truckers control of their privacy when they are off duty.</p>

            <h4>Defining Goals</h4>

            <hr>

            <h5>Updating the user interface</h5>
            <p>Development had been underway for almost a year by the time I joined. There were only a few months until launch, but a lot of UI work needed to replace placeholders from developers. Alongside our lead visual designer, I finished a Sketch library of Google Material Design components so it could be used across our team, so I implemented those best practices for OnTime. With a design library in place, I was able to quickly create high fidelity mockups for developer handoff.</p>

            <h5>Establishing a UX &amp; product process</h5>
            <p>To keep overall production vision in line, I enacted twice weekly design reviews with product. This helped temper "drive-thru product development", where decisions would be made during impromptu desk-side conversations. These twice weekly meetings were put in place to ensure we were all on the same page, talking to each other, and drawing boundaries in regards to sticking to overall goals by having everything in writing.</p>

            <h5>Lessons learned</h5>
            <p><strong>Saying no</strong>. UX portfolios are typically places of seamless storytelling, with slick photos of sticky notes on walls from brainstorming sessions and clear problems with clear solutions. This was not such a product. If I had a magic wand, I would've pushed for a </p>
