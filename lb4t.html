            <h3>A mobile load board for truckers</h3>
            <p>coming soon</p>

            <h4>What's a load board, anyway?</h4>
            <hr>
            <p><a href="http://dat.com/">DAT Solutions</a> operates the United States' largest load boards (freight marketplace). Load boards help truck drivers, brokers, and shippers keep our roads loaded with freight with goods and food we rely on everyday. Load boards have trace their origins to notes on physical boards at truckstops about where to find freight. Now, load boards are a digital marketplace for truckers and brokers. Think of a load board as a "Craigslist for truckers", a place where brokers and shippers list their freight and truckers (typically owner-operators) post their availability.</p>

            <h4>Load Board for Truckers</h4>
            <hr>

            <h5>Injecting new life into a quietly successful app</h5>
            <p>Load Board for Truckers (LB4T for short), is DAT's mobile load board app. Originally released in 2016, it received a few updates, but priorities shifted and that team went on to work on other projects. Over the next year, LB4T quietly grew and kept growing until it became DAT's largest load board in terms of daily active users and load searches. <em>Whoa, right?</em> Truckers aren't checking their computers, they're checking their phones. All the time.</p>

            <p>To keep momentum going in LB4T's success, we wanted to revisit the app to see where we could improve. In conversations with truckers who used LB4T at <a href="http://truckingshow.com/">Mid America Trucking Show</a> in Louisville, Kentucky, I heard over and over again how they loved its simplicity. I kept that in mind when returning back to Portland. I think it's easy for teams to get caught up in reactionary style-development, where one review, support ticket, or conversation with a person can mean making drastic product changes. There was a lot of UX debt to address in LB4T and a lot of potential feature enhancements, but I didn't want to break trust with those who were already relying on it for day to day business.</p>

            <h4>Tight knit team = happy team</h4>
            <hr>

            <h5>No more working in silos</h5>
            <p>I worked in a tight knit and collaborative environment with LB4T product and engineering. This meant conducting regular meetings with stakeholders, taking part in ideation sessions to help define our goals and address immediate issues, and meeting with product multiple times a week to ensure we weren't working in silos.</p>

            <p>With a robust Material design system in place, I was able to quickly produce high fidelity mockups for feature enhancements. When we were still defining completely new concepts, I steered towards low and mid fidelity so we could cycle through more rapid iterations. LB4T was among the first projects at DAT where UX designers used Figma. Its sharing capabilities felt like I was never truly designing 'alone', as there was almost always at least one other person in my file looking around or leaving comments. It was admittedly a little weird at first (and forced me to be more organized! ðŸ˜…), but I truly enjoyed feeling like we were all building something great together.</p>

            <h5>Tons of opportunity</h5>
            <p>I helped and created initial concepts that will help LB4T intelligently match truckers with</p>
