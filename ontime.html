            <h3>A real-time freight tracking platform</h3>

            <h4>Modernizing a 40+ year old company</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>I was one of three visual designers assigned the task of giving DAT's entire product suite a visual and UX overhaul using Google's Material Design as a starting point. It felt like a herculean task as some products hadn't been updated in over a decade, but the first product I took on was their newest, <strong>OnTime</strong>.</p>

            <h4>OnTime</h4>
            <hr>

            <h5>What is OnTime?</h5>
            <p>OnTime is a product that allows freight brokers and shippers to track drivers carrying their freight. How it works is truck drivers download OnTime's app on their phones and are tracked for a shipment's duration via GPS. Brokers and shippers check OnTime's web app to see real time updates regarding their freight's location. OnTime sets itself apart from competitors with features like in-app messaging, real time location updates, and giving truckers control of their privacy when they are off duty.</p>

            <h4>Defining Goals</h4>

            <hr>

            <h5>User interface refresh</h5>
            <p>Development had been underway for almost a year when I joined. There were only a few months until launch, but a lot of UI work needed to be done to replace placeholders by developers. Alongside our lead visual designer, I finished a Sketch library of Google Material Design components so it could be used across our team, so I implemented those best practices for OnTime. With a design library in place, I was able to quickly create high fidelity mockups for developer handoff.</p>

            <a href="img/projects/dat/OnTime_web_detail.jpg"><img src="img/projects/dat/OnTime_web_detail.jpg" class="secondary-img" alt="OnTime web screenshot"></a>

            <h5>Establishing a UX &amp; product process</h5>
            <p>To keep overall vision in line, I enacted twice weekly design reviews with product. This helped temper "drive-thru product development", where decisions would be made during impromptu desk-side conversations. These twice weekly meetings were put in place to ensure we were all on the same page, talking to each other, and drawing boundaries in regards to sticking to goals by having everything in writing.</p>

            <h5>Preparing for launch ðŸš€</h5>
            <p>Time was tight, so frequent usability testing wasn't an option. However, our superhuman of a researcher was slated to attend two large industry conventions a couple weeks before launch, so we jumped on that as an opportunity for usability testing. Better late than never! I cranked out two clickable prototypes in a week that fully replicated an end to end web app and mobile app experiences. Our researcher returned with findings that both validated our assumptions and surprised us completely, but this gave me lots to iterate on.</p>

            <h5>Pushing back for what's right</h5>
            <p>UX portfolios are typically places of seamless storytelling, with slick photos of sticky notes on walls from brainstorming sessions and clear problems with clear solutions. This was not such a product. If I had a magic wand, I would've pushed back on limitations, whether they were due to deadlines or if we were only building something because it neatly fit into one sprint cycle.</p>
            <p>I'd completely revamp OnTime's mobile onboarding experience. Its largest competitor was a simple SMS app that required no sign up, no login, and no installation. Although the competition was 'hated' by truckers because it tracked them at all times, users appreciated its simplicity. Feedback for our app was favorable; especially in regards to privacy, but adoption was poor. There were too many barriers to even getting started. Drivers received a deep link via text to Google Play/App Store to download, then they had to install, sign up for a DAT account, activate their DAT account through email, verify their phone number through a text message, and only then could they accept shipment tracking. As a junior member team member, I didn't feel comfortable enough pushing back about these hurdles, though I knew I <em>should</em>. There were still plenty of bright spots during my tenure, but <strong>not speaking up to advocate for users helped form how I've approached all projects since.</strong></p>
